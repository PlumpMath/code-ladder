Code Ladder: fold code in indented syntax
------

### About

This is an exercise of using Browserify and organizing CoffeeScript code.  
Also I have an idea about viewing code in another angle.  

### develop

Run `node-dev dev.coffee` to reload the code.  
Read `dev.coffee` for the command line tools you may need.  

### Demo

Visit Github Pages for demo: http://jiyinyiyong.github.io/code-ladder/build
